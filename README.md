## NOTE:
### If using the .py's and getting a call back for "Missing module" "Missing attributes to ____"
## or anything along those lines, you need to make a Virtual Environment within VSCODE terminal.
# Here's how:
(if ur on linux you shouldnt not know the damn alternative commands)

1. Make the VENV.
   ```terminal
   python -m venv file_path_to_your_project/venv
   ```
2. Open a new terminal with the VENV\
   Right click the newly created VENV file and "Open new terminal instance"

3. Change to each directory, adding each necassary attribute or module.
   ```terminal
   cd path_to_each_project
   ```
   ```terminal
   pip install module_or_atribute
   ```
